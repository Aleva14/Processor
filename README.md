# Processor
The program is supposed to run programs on a simple c-like language

Files in the project:
0)Stack library for processor
1)Processor - a model of a stack processor which executes instructions and makes syscalls
2)Assembler - translates assembler file to instructions for processor

After finishing processor I'll start writing compiler or understanding how to use bizon and flex
